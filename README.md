## 📦 Project Structure

Each project follows the MVC pattern:

- **Model:** Manages data (API calls, LocalStorage, etc.)
- **View:** Handles DOM rendering and user interface
- **Controller:** Coordinates logic between model and view

Bundling is handled by **Parcel**, chosen for its zero-config setup and ease of use for beginners.

Project selection is managed using a CLI prompt (`start.js`) built with `inquirer`, which allows easy development of individual apps.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally
